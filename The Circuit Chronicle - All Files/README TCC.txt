Notes for The Circuit Chronicle:

In order for this program to work, you must unzip the file for the executable or alternatively, run the source code in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. The file locations are refereced within the program for the Excel sheets and Images, so do not move them. 

I used 7Zip to compress the Executable file to a size that GitHub will allow. As a result, a service such as 7Zip may need to be utilised in order to combine the two and unzip them. Only then will the shortcut work. 

The libraries that you will need are included in the source code but should easily be downloaded as extensions.

This program works by accessing the Excel sheets to find the calculations for each laptime scenario, and after reading the data, it builds a graph and displays the laptime to the user. I made this as my project for the BTEC Level 3 Diploma in Engineering, and worked on it over the course of several months. My aim with this program was to demonstrate some of my knowledge in the more mathematical areas, as well as displaying my motorsport interest in a way that I found both challenging and interesting.
